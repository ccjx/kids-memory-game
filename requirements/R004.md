# R004: Dynamic UI and Font Scaling with Resolution Changes

## Overview
Ensure all UI elements and fonts scale proportionally when the user changes the resolution setting, providing a consistent visual experience across different screen sizes.

## Detailed Description
Currently, when users change resolution in the Settings menu, the viewport size changes but UI elements and fonts remain at fixed sizes. This requirement addresses this by implementing dynamic scaling based on the selected resolution.

**Current Behavior:**
- Resolution change only affects window/viewport size
- UI elements (buttons, panels, labels) maintain fixed pixel dimensions
- Font sizes remain constant regardless of resolution
- Visual hierarchy and readability may vary across resolutions

**Desired Behavior:**
- All UI elements scale proportionally with resolution changes
- Font sizes adjust to maintain readability at different resolutions
- Spacing, margins, and padding scale accordingly
- Visual consistency maintained across Desktop (1920x1080), High-DPI (2560x1440), and iPad Mini (2048x1536) resolutions

**Scope:**
- Main Menu buttons and title
- Settings menu controls and labels
- Game Scene UI (back button, grid container spacing)
- Victory Panel and its contents
- Wrong Match POC menu
- All font sizes across all scenes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UI elements scale proportionally when resolution is changed in Settings
- [ ] Font sizes adjust to maintain readability at each resolution preset
- [ ] Button sizes, margins, and padding scale appropriately
- [ ] Visual hierarchy remains consistent across all resolutions
- [ ] No UI clipping or overflow at any supported resolution
- [ ] Changes apply immediately when resolution is changed (no restart required)
- [ ] Scale factors are consistent across all scenes

## Dependencies
- R002 (Multi-Resolution Support) - requires existing resolution management system

## Notes
- Consider using a base resolution (e.g., Desktop 1920x1080) as reference
- Scale factor could be calculated as: current_resolution_width / base_resolution_width
- May need to create a global theme or scaling singleton
- Font scaling should use scale factors rather than fixed sizes per resolution
