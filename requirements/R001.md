# R001: Kids Memory Game Core Features

## Overview
Implement the core functionality for a kids memory matching game, including main menu navigation, game mechanics, and basic settings infrastructure.

## Detailed Description
This requirement encompasses the fundamental features needed for a functional memory game built in Godot 4.3 for mobile platforms.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Godot version: 4.3
- Rendering method: Mobile
- Target platform: Mobile (touch-optimized)
- Scene architecture: Separate scenes with transitions
- Settings persistence: Godot's ConfigFile system

**Main Menu System:**
- Main menu screen with three options: New Game, Settings, and Exit
- New Game button transitions to the game scene
- Settings button transitions to settings scene (placeholder for now)
- Exit button quits the application

**Game Mechanics:**
- Memory matching game with configurable tile counts (8, 12, 16, or 24 tiles)
- Default tile count: 8 tiles (4 pairs)
- Each tile has a back image (same for all tiles when face-down)
- Tiles flip when tapped to reveal the front image
- Players flip two tiles per turn to find matching pairs
- **Match behavior**: Matched tiles stay visible/face-up on the board
- **Non-match behavior**: Tiles auto-flip back after 5 seconds delay
- **Win condition**: When all pairs are found, show celebratory message "Complete!"
- Use images of Singapore city landmarks from unsplash.com (12 unique pairs prepared)

**Settings:**
- Settings page structure (currently blank/placeholder)
- Tile count configuration option (8, 12, 16, or 24 tiles)
- Settings saved using Godot's ConfigFile system
