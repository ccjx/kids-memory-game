# R002: Multi-Resolution Support and Enhanced Visual Feedback

## Overview
Add support for multiple screen resolutions with dynamic UI scaling, improved tile positioning, enhanced 3D flip animations, and visual feedback for non-matching tiles.

## Detailed Description
This requirement enhances the game's visual presentation and usability across different devices and screen resolutions.

**Multi-Resolution Support:**
- Support desktop resolutions (standard DPI)
- Support high-DPI desktop resolutions (like MacBook Pro Retina displays)
- Support iPad Mini resolutions
- Resolution setting configurable in the Settings page
- All UI elements scale appropriately based on selected resolution

**Tile Layout Improvements:**
- Tiles positioned more centrally on the screen
- Dynamic sizing based on viewport and tile count
- Maintain proper spacing and aspect ratios across resolutions

**Enhanced Animations:**
- Replace current 2D flip animation with 3D flip effect
- Tile should rotate on Y-axis to simulate realistic card flip
- Smooth transition showing front and back during rotation

**Visual Feedback System:**
- When tiles don't match: display red outline on both cards
- Blink effect: outline appears and disappears 2 times
- Total blink duration: 500ms (250ms per blink cycle)
- Feedback occurs before the 5-second auto-flip timer

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Settings page includes resolution selector with options for:
  - [ ] Desktop (standard DPI)
  - [ ] High-DPI Desktop (Retina/4K displays)
  - [ ] iPad Mini resolution
- [ ] Resolution changes apply immediately or on game restart
- [ ] Tiles scale proportionally to viewport size
- [ ] Tiles are centered within the game board area
- [ ] Grid layout adapts to different aspect ratios
- [ ] 3D flip animation implemented using Y-axis rotation
- [ ] Flip animation shows gradual transition from back to front
- [ ] Non-matching tiles display red outline
- [ ] Red outline blinks exactly 2 times within 500ms
- [ ] Negative feedback completes before auto-flip timer starts
- [ ] All animations perform smoothly at 60 FPS
- [ ] UI remains responsive during resolution changes

## Dependencies
- R001 (requires existing game implementation to enhance)

## Notes
- Consider using Godot's ViewportContainer or CanvasLayer for resolution scaling
- 3D rotation can be achieved using rotation_degrees on Y-axis with pivot adjustment
- For iPad Mini: typical resolution is 2048x1536 (Retina) or 1024x768 (non-Retina)
- High-DPI detection may require checking display scale factor
- Red outline effect can be implemented using a ColorRect border or shader
- Consider performance impact of 3D rotations on mobile devices
- May need to adjust card back/front texture visibility during flip rotation
