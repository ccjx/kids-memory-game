# R003: Animation POC for Victory and Wrong Match Effects

## Overview
Create a proof-of-concept menu to showcase multiple animation options for victory screen and wrong tile match effects, allowing selection of the best option for final implementation.

## Detailed Description
This requirement creates a separate POC environment to test and compare different animation approaches before implementing them in the main game.

**Animation POC Menu:**
- Add new menu item "Animation POC" to main menu
- Separate scene dedicated to testing animations
- Options presented as selectable buttons (Option 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- Each option demonstrates the animation in action

**Victory Screen Animation Options:**

**Option 1 - Confetti Burst:**
- Colorful confetti particles explode from center
- Particles fall with gravity and fade out
- "Complete!" text scales up with bounce effect
- Technically feasible using Godot's CPUParticles2D or GPUParticles2D

**Option 2 - Star Cascade:**
- Stars cascade down from top of screen
- "Complete!" text appears with shimmer/sparkle effect
- Background pulses with color gradient
- Uses particle system + shader for shimmer

**Option 3 - Trophy Rise:**
- Trophy/medal icon rises from bottom with elastic easing
- Rays of light radiate from behind trophy
- "Complete!" fades in above trophy
- Uses Tween animations + sprite rotation for rays

**Option 4 - Fireworks Display:**
- Multiple firework bursts at random positions
- Each burst has trail particles and explosion
- "Complete!" appears with typewriter effect
- Particle system with varied colors and timing

**Wrong Match Animation Options:**

**Option 1 - Shake + Red Flash:**
- Both tiles shake horizontally (small quick movements)
- Red overlay flashes on tiles 2 times
- Screen rumble effect (camera shake)
- Uses Tween for shake, ColorRect for flash

**Option 2 - Bounce Back:**
- Tiles bounce backward slightly as if repelled
- Red "X" symbol appears above each tile briefly
- Error sound emphasis
- Spring-like animation using elastic easing

**Option 3 - Wobble + Dim:**
- Tiles wobble/rotate slightly left and right
- Tiles temporarily dim with red tint overlay
- Pulse effect on red outline
- Rotation + modulate property animation

**Option 4 - Electric Spark:**
- Red electric spark/zigzag appears between tiles
- Tiles flash white then red
- Brief screen flash effect
- Line2D animated path + color modulation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Animation POC" option added to main menu
- [ ] Animation POC scene created with option selector UI
- [ ] Victory screen has 4 distinct animation options implemented
- [ ] Wrong match has 4 distinct animation options implemented
- [ ] Each option can be triggered individually for preview
- [ ] Option buttons clearly labeled (Victory Option 1-4, Wrong Match Option 1-4)
- [ ] Animations loop or can be retriggered for comparison
- [ ] Back button returns to main menu
- [ ] All animations run smoothly at 60 FPS
- [ ] Animations are technically feasible for mobile deployment
- [ ] POC implementation is separate from main game code

## Dependencies
- R001 (uses existing game assets and structure)

## Notes
- This is a POC requirement - implementation should be quick and iterative
- Focus on visual effect, not production polish
- Animations should demonstrate the concept clearly
- Consider performance on mobile devices when implementing
- User will select preferred options which will then be refined and integrated into main game
- May want to add ability to adjust animation speed for better evaluation
- Could include side-by-side comparison mode
- POC scene can be removed or hidden after final selections are made
